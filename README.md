# Project Name : Some C functions

# ft_itoa_base.c
Function that converts an integer value to string using the specified base.
The base is an integer, from 2 to 16.
(For example, base 4 would be "0123" and base 16 "0123456789ABCDEF").
For base 10 and negative value, the resulting string is preceded with a minus sign (-).
With any other base, value is always considered unsigned.
